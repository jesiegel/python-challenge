# python-challenge

In this assignment I focused on two sets of data, budget data and election data. With the budget csv file, I used a Python script to analyze the records and output the following values:

- Total number of months
- Net toal amount of Profit/Losses
- The average change in Profit/Losses
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount)
- The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount)

For the election dataset, I used a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates the following values:

- Total number of votes
- List of candidates who received votes
- Percentage of votes each candidate won
- Total number of votes each candidate won
- The winner of the election based on a majority vote
